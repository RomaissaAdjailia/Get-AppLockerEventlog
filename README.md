**2. Block**

This gets all the events that are triggered by the action of blocking an application by AppLocker, this type is critical for threat-hunting or forensics, and comes with high priority, since it indicates malicious attempts, or could be a good indicator of prior malicious activity in order to evade defensive mechanisms.

```

**3. Allow**

This gets all the events that are triggered by the action of Allowing an application by AppLocker. For threat-hunting or forensics, even the allowed applications should be monitored, in order to detect any possible bypass or configuration mistakes.

```

**4. Audit**

This gets all the events generated when AppLocker would block the application if the enforcement mode were enabled (Audit mode). For threat-hunting or forensics, this could indicate any configuration mistake, neglect from the admin to switch the mode, or even a malicious action that happened in the audit phase (tuning phase).
